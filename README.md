# Extra materials to support my book

As well as the primary [GitHub repository for my book](https://github.com/markjprice/cs9dotnet5), I have created this repo to add extra materials.

## C# 9 and .NET 5 - Modern Cross-Platform Development
Slide decks for teachers using the book, supporting topics related to the book, and early drafts of topics for future editions.

## [Slide Decks](/slide-decks/README.md)
I plan to create PowerPoint slide decks for each chapter that can be used in the classroom or delivered remotely online.

## [Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 on Windows](/vs2019-windows/README.md)
Some people are not ready to embrace cross-platform development using Visual Studio Code. 

In this article, I show:
- How to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 on Windows
- How to create a Console Application project
- How to use solutions to combine multiple projects

## [Using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 on macOS](/vs2019-macos/README.md)
Some people are not ready to embrace cross-platform development using Visual Studio Code. 

In this article, I show:
- How to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 on macOS
- How to create a Console Application project
- How to use solutions to combine multiple projects

## [Using Microsoft SQL Server on Windows](/sqlserver/README.md)
SQLite is a popular cross-platform relational database but if you are using Windows then a more powerful choice is SQL Server.

In this article, I show:
- How to install Microsoft SQL Server LocalDb on Windows
- How to run the SQL script for the book to create the Northwind database
- How to write a connection string for SQL Server

## [Using a Raspberry Pi 400 with its native 32-bit OS](/raspberry-pi-os32/README.md)
Raspberry Pi is a great value way to get into programming because Visual Studio Code on the Raspberry Pi is officially supported by the development team. 

Its default operating system is a 32-bit derivative of Debian previously known as Raspian and now known as Raspberry Pi OS. 

In this article, I show:
- How to install Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- How to install Microsoft .NET 5 SDK
- Explain the current limitations

## [Using a Raspberry Pi 400 with Ubuntu 64](/raspberry-pi-ubuntu64/README.md)
Raspberry Pi is a great value way to get into programming because Visual Studio Code on the Raspberry Pi is officially supported by the development team. 

To develop on a 64-bit operating system I recommend creating a microSD card with Ubuntu Desktop 64-bit version 20.10 code-named Groovy Gorilla.

In this article, I show:
- How to create an Ubuntu Desktop 64-bit boot microSD card
- How to install Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- How to install Microsoft .NET 5 SDK
- Explain the current limitations

## [ID or Id?](/ID-or-Id/README.md)
What is the recommended naming convention for IDs? Let's find out!

## [Apple Silicon](/apple-silicon/README.md)
Microsoft is already hard at work to make Visual Studio Code and .NET 5 run on Apple Silicon. I have bought a Mac mini with an M1 chip to try it out as soon as Microsoft releases compatible versions of their software.

## [Understanding ASP.NET Core Architecture](/aspnetcore-architecture/README.md)
In this article, I will review the architecture of ASP.NET Core in more depth than was possible in the published book, including answering the following common questions:
- What is the difference between Program.cs and Startup.cs? Why do I need both? Where should I put code that runs when the website initializes? 
- How do dependency services work?
